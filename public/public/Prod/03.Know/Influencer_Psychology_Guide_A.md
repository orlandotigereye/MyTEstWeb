# Influencer Psychology & Partnership Success | 影響力人士心理學與合作成功指南

How to approach high-authority riggers and get them to promote your tool.
如何開發高權威綁定師並讓他們主動推廣您的工具。

## 🧠 1. The "Ego-Stroking" Opener | 「讚美開場」
Influencers are human. They value recognition of their skill more than a generic sales pitch.
影響力人士也是人，他們重視對其技能的認可勝過一般的推銷。
- **Don't**: "I have a tool for you."
- **Do**: "I’ve been following your work on [Character Name]—the way you rigged the eye-tracking is the best I've seen in the community."
- **Why**: This proves you are a genuine fan, not a bot or a spammer.

## 🧠 2. The "Status Exchange" | 價值與地位交換
Riggers want to look like "Tech Leaders" to their clients.
綁定師希望在客戶面前展現「技術領先」的形象。
- **Action**: Position your tool as a "Secret Weapon" they can offer to their clients. 
- **Pitch**: "I want to give you an exclusive license so your clients can have the smoothest showcases in the industry."
- **重點**：將工具定位為他們可以提供給客戶的「秘密武器」。

## 🧠 3. The "Micro-Commitment" | 「微小承諾」策略
Don't ask for a full partnership in the first message.
不要在第一則訊息就要求正式合作。
- **Action**: Ask them to just *look* at a 15-second demo.
- **Pitch**: "I made a 15-second clip showing your rigging style automated—want to see it?"
- **Why**: A "Yes" to seeing a video is easy. Once they see the quality, they will ask *you* how to get it.

## 🧠 4. Handling "Ghosting" | 如何處理不回覆
If they don't reply, it's usually because they are busy, not uninterested.
如果不回覆，通常是因為太忙，而非沒興趣。
- **Follow-up (3 days later)**: "Hey! Just wanted to make sure you saw that clip. I'm letting 3 top riggers test the Pro version for free this week—would love for you to be one of them."
- **重點**：使用「稀缺性」（限額 3 名）來引發對方的行動動機。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
The best partners are the "Mid-Tier" creators (1k-5k followers). They are active, growing, and much more likely to reply and engage than the superstars with 100k+ followers.
