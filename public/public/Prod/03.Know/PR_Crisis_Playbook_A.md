## 🚨 1. Scenario: The "Automation is Lazy" Debate
**Risk**: Critics claim that using your tool is "cheating" or reduces the quality of art.
**風險**：批評者認為使用自動化工具是「作弊」或降低藝術品質。

- **Strategy**: Reframe the tool as a **"Time-Saver for Mastery."**
- **Public Response**: "We believe automation handles the *repetitive labor* so artists can focus on the *creative soul*. Our tool doesn't rig the model; it showcases the artist's hard work in the best possible light."
- **核心論點**：強調工具處理的是「重複性勞動」，讓藝術家能專注於「創作靈魂」。

## 🚨 2. Scenario: A High-Profile Technical Bug
**Risk**: An influencer records a video and it glitches, making the tool look bad publicly.
**風險**：影響力人士錄製時出錯，導致工具形象受損。

- **Strategy**: **Extreme Transparency.**
- **Action**: Immediately comment on their post (or DM them): "We saw the glitch! [Technical Reason] caused it. We've pushed a fix in v1.2 and would love to help you re-record it for free."
- **重點**：承認錯誤、解釋原因、立即修復並提供補償。

---

## 🚨 3. Scenario: Negative Competitor Comparisons
**Risk**: Someone posts: "[Competitor Tool] is better than this."
**風險**：有人公開評論競爭對手更好。

- **Strategy**: **The "Complimentary Pivot."**
- **Response**: "[Competitor Tool] is a great piece of software! We built the Portfolio Master specifically for [Your Unique Feature, e.g., Scripted Duo Dialogue], which solves a different part of the workflow. We love seeing more tools support the community!"
- **重點**：稱讚對手，但強調自己的獨特差異化價值。

---

## 🛡️ 4. The "Stop the Bleeding" Rule
If a thread becomes toxic or filled with bad-faith arguments:
如果討論串變得有毒或充斥惡意爭論：
- **Action**: Provide one final professional response and then **Disengage**. Do not "Feed the Trolls."
- **行動**：提供最後一次專業回覆後即「停止互動」，不要與酸民糾纏。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Use your **Discord Community** as a "Firewall." Your most loyal users will often defend your brand against unfair criticism before you even see the post!
