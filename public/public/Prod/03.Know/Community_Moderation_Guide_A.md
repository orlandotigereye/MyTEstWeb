## 📜 2. The "Artist-First" Code of Conduct | 行為準則
Paste these rules in your `#📜-rules` channel.
將這些規則貼在您的 `#📜-rules` 頻道中。

1. **Be Respectful**: No "Art-Shaming." We are here to help each other grow. (尊重他人：嚴禁嘲諷作品)
2. **No Unsolicited DMs**: Do not message members to sell your own services. (禁止私訊推銷)
3. **Credit the Tools**: If you post in `#✨-showcase`, mention the script version used. (標註工具：展示作品時請註明使用的腳本版本)
4. **English/Chinese Only**: Keep discussions in the languages the staff understands. (語言限制：僅限中英文討論)

## 🛡️ 3. Handling Conflict | 處理衝突流程
- **Stage 1 (Warning)**: Private DM explaining which rule was broken. (私訊警告)
- **Stage 2 (Mute)**: Temporary 24-hour mute if the behavior continues. (暫時禁言)

## 🚀 4. Scaling with "Community Helpers" | 招募小幫手
Once you hit 500 members, look for the most active and helpful free users. Offer them a **Free Lifetime Pro License** in exchange for being a "Moderator." This keeps your labor costs at zero while growing your team.

## 💡 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Set up a "Slow Mode" (e.g., 1 message every 30 seconds) in the `#🆘-technical-support` channel. This prevents people from spamming questions and gives you time to provide quality answers.
