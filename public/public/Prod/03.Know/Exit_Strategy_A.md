# Exit Strategy & Acquisition Prep | 退出策略與收購準備

Build your business so it can run—and be sold—without you.
打造一個即便沒有您也能運作（且能被出售）的事業。

## 🏛️ 1. The "Sellable" Business | 具備出售價值的事業
A buyer doesn't buy your code; they buy your **Future Revenue**.
買家買的不是您的程式碼，而是您的「未來營收」。
- **Documentation**: Every strategy we've built today (Notion, Guides, Trackers) adds value to your business. (完整的文件紀錄是價值的來源)
- **Growth Trend**: A steady increase in monthly revenue is more attractive than a single big month. (穩定成長的營收曲線)

## 🏛️ 2. Clean Financials | 清晰的財務紀錄
- Use the **Income and Sales Tracker** to maintain a 12-month history of every dollar earned.
- Keep your business expenses separate from personal ones.
- **重點**：帳目清晰是收購談判的第一步。

## 🏛️ 3. Reducing "Key Man" Risk | 降低「關鍵人」風險
If the business stops working when you go on vacation, it's not a business; it's a job.
如果您休假事業就停擺，那這不是事業，而是一份工作。
- Use the **VA Delegation Roadmap** to ensure repetitive tasks are handled by others.
- Automate as much as possible using the **Business Automation Guide**.
- **重點**：越不需要您親自參與，價值就越高。

---

## 🏛️ 4. The Exit Options | 退出選擇
- **Micro-Acquisition**: Sell to another VTuber tech creator for $10k - $50k.
- **Agency Buyout**: A large VTuber agency buys your tool to keep it exclusive for their talents.
- **Strategic Merger**: Partner with a complementary tool (e.g., an AI voice tool) to create a larger suite.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Think of this project as a **Product**, not a hobby. Every guide we wrote today is a "Standard Operating Procedure" (SOP) that makes your business attractive to potential buyers.
