# Strategic Partnership 2.0: The Agency Pitch | 戰略夥伴開發 2.0：經紀公司提案策略

How to secure bulk contracts and high-ticket service deals with VTuber agencies.
如何與 VTuber 經紀公司簽署批量合約與高單價服務協議。

## 🏢 1. Why Target Agencies? | 為什麼鎖定經紀公司？
- **Volume**: One deal covers all their talents (10 - 100+ characters).
- **Retention**: Agencies have long-term budgets and need consistent output.
- **Authority**: Being the "Official Automation Partner" for an agency is the ultimate brand validation.
- **重點**：經紀公司合約是達成每月 5,000 美元目標的最短路徑。

---

## 🏢 2. Finding the Right Agencies | 尋找目標公司
Focus on "Mid-Tier" and "Indie" agencies first.
優先鎖定「中階」與「獨立」經紀公司。
- **Search**: Look for "VTuber Group Debut" or "New Generation Launch" on X (Twitter).
- **Target**: Agencies with 5-20 active talents. They are big enough to have a budget but small enough to still be agile.
- **重點**：搜尋「新期數發布」的訊息，這是他們最需要高效錄影工具的時候。

## 💬 3. The "Enterprise" Pitch | 企業級提案腳本
"Hi [Agency Manager Name], I’ve been following [Agency Name]’s growth—the production value of your recent debuts is incredible. I specialize in VTuber workflow automation. I’ve developed an engine that allows your riggers and managers to record high-quality character showcases 90% faster than manual OBS capture. I’d love to show you how our **Agency Suite** can standardize your content quality while significantly reducing your labor costs."

## 💰 4. Agency-Specific Pricing | 針對經紀公司的定價
Don't use individual prices. Use **Bulk Licenses**.
不要使用個人定價，使用「批量授權」。
- **The Bundle**: $499 per generation (up to 5 talents).
- **Includes**: Custom local dashboard + Priority technical support + Brand-specific backgrounds.
- **重點**：提供「全包式」服務，讓經紀公司經理覺得省事又超值。

---

## 🚀 5. The "White-Label" Offer | 白牌服務提案
- **Action**: Offer to add the **Agency Logo** to the automation dashboard.
- **Value**: It makes the agency look like they have their own proprietary internal technology.
- **重點**：為工具換上經紀公司的 Logo，這能讓他們更有意願支付高額溢價。

---

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Use the **Partner Info Deck** as a base, but create a special "Agency Page" in your **Authority Website Strategy**. High-end managers want to see a dedicated section for "Enterprise Solutions."
