# Personalized Video Pitch Strategy | 客製化影片提案策略

How to win over the industry's top creators with a "Magic" first impression.
如何透過「魔幻」的第一印象贏得業界頂尖創作者的青睞。

## 🎬 1. The Strategy: Show, Don't Tell | 核心策略
Instead of a long email, you send a 15-second video of **THEIR** model performing a perfectly smooth automated showcase.
與其寫長篇大論，不如直接傳送一段**他們自己**模型進行完美自動錄影的 15 秒影片。

## 🛠️ 2. The Step-by-Step Process | 執行步驟

### **Step A: The Target Selection**
Pick a top-tier rigger (5k+ followers) who has a publicly available `.moc3` demo or whose character you can find.
挑選一位擁有公開模型或演示素材的高階綁定師。

### **Step B: The Recording**
1. Setup their model in your **L09 Template**.
2. Write a short script: "Hi [Artist Name]! I automated this showcase using the Live2D Portfolio Master. Thought you'd like the smooth physics!"
3. Run the **Pro D Script** to get the MP4.
4. **重點**：讓對方的角色親自「推銷」您的工具。

### **Step C: The DM (The "Gift" Approach)**
"Hey [Name]! I'm a huge fan of your rigging. I actually used your [Model Name] to test a new automation tool I built—the physics turned out so smooth I had to share the clip with you! (Attach Video). If you want the full version to use for your own portfolio, it’s yours for free. Just let me know!"

## 🚀 3. Why this works | 為什麼這有效
- **Unstoppable Curiosity**: No one can resist watching a video of their own character.
- **Proof of Value**: You've already solved their problem (recording) before they even asked.
- **Reciprocity**: Giving them a high-quality video for free makes them feel obligated to reply or thank you.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Mention that you recorded the video at **12 FPS** to get that "perfect physics" look. Professional riggers will immediately understand the technical brilliance of this method.
