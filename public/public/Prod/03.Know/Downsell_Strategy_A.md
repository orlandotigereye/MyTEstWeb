# Revenue Optimization: The "Downsell" Strategy | 營收優化：減售策略

How to capture revenue from customers who say "No" to your main offer.
如何從拒絕主產品的客戶身上獲取營收。

---

## 📉 1. The Concept | 核心概念
A "Downsell" is a cheaper, smaller version of your product offered immediately after someone declines your main $29 Pro Bundle.
「減售」是指在客戶拒絕 29 美元主產品後，立即提供的一個更便宜、更精簡的版本。

## 📉 2. High-Value "Mini-Pack" Ideas | 減售產品提案 ($9 Each)

### **A. The Cinematic Background Pack**
- **Offer**: Just the 5 custom 4K backgrounds from the Pro version.
- **Why**: Many artists already have their own scripts but lack professional backgrounds.
- **提案**：電影級背景包。僅包含專業版中的 5 款 4K 背景。

### **B. The "Expression Master" Script**
- **Offer**: Just the **Dynamic Expression Randomizer** logic and setup.
- **Why**: Perfect for riggers who want their models to look "Alive" but don't need full automation.
- **提案**：「表情大師」腳本。僅提供動態表情隨機發生器的邏輯與設定。

## 🛠️ 3. How to Execute | 執行方式
- **Option 1 (Email)**: If a user clicks the Pro Bundle link but doesn't buy, send an automated email 48 hours later: "Is $29 too much right now? Grab just the backgrounds for only $9!"
- **Option 2 (Bento.me)**: List your products in order: Pro Bundle ($29) -> Mini-Packs ($9) -> Free Template ($0).
- **重點**：讓產品階梯具備多個價格點，以適應不同預算的客戶。

## 📈 4. The "Recoup" Math | 財務效益
- If you spend $5/day on ads and get zero Pro sales, but two $9 Mini-Pack sales, you have **$18 revenue**, making your ads profitable even without a big sale!
- **重點**：減售策略是維持廣告獲利能力的保險絲。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
On your Gumroad page for the $9 Mini-Pack, include a small text: "Upgrade to the Full Pro Bundle anytime for just the difference in price!" This makes the $9 purchase feel like a safe "Trial."
