## 🔍 1. Proactive Monitoring | 主動監控
- **Search Alerts**: Set up **Google Alerts** for "Live2D Automation Script" and "Portfolio Master" to see when new pages mention your tool.
- **Gumroad Search**: Occasionally search for similar tools on Gumroad or Booth to ensure nobody is reselling your exact files.
- **行動**：設定關鍵字警報，並定期搜尋相關平台，確保無人盜賣您的檔案。

## 🛡️ 2. Plagiarism Response Protocol | 抄襲應對協議
If you find someone reselling your code:
如果您發現有人盜賣您的程式碼：

1. **Document**: Take screenshots of the unauthorized listing and the seller's profile. (存證：截圖記錄盜賣頁面)
2. **Contact (The Soft Approach)**: Send a firm DM: "I noticed you are reselling the Live2D Portfolio Master code. This is a violation of our Licensing Terms. Please remove this listing within 24 hours to avoid further action."
3. **The DMCA Takedown (The Hard Approach)**: If they refuse, file a DMCA notice with the platform (Gumroad, Booth, or their web host).
- **重點**：大多數盜賣者在收到正式警告後都會退縮。

## 🤝 3. The "Community Defense" | 社群防禦
- Encourage your **Discord Community** to report any copies they see. 
- Give a "Bounty" (e.g., a free custom background) to anyone who helps you catch a major plagiarizer.
- **行動**：發動社群力量，獎勵舉報盜版的使用者。

## 🏛️ 4. Branding as Protection | 品牌即保護
- Pirated code is just a file. Your brand is a **Relationship**.
- People buy from *you* because of your support, your updates, and your reputation. The more you focus on **Personal Branding**, the harder it is for pirates to steal your customers.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Add a "hidden comment" in your `.js` files with your name and website. This makes it much easier to prove ownership if you ever need to file a formal complaint.
