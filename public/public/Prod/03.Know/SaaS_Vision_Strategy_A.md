# Future Vision: Transitioning to a SaaS Platform | 未來願景：轉型為 SaaS 平台

The roadmap to turning your local scripts into a global software business.
將本地腳本轉化為全球軟體事業的路線圖。

---

## 🚀 1. The Core Concept | 核心概念
Move from "Run scripts on your PC" to "Record in the Cloud."
從「在電腦跑腳本」轉向「在雲端錄影」。
- **User Action**: Uploads `.moc3` files and a Google Sheet link to your website.
- **System Action**: A cloud server (AWS/Azure) runs the Puppeteer script in the background.
- **Output**: The user receives an Email with a download link to their finished MP4.

---

## 🚀 2. Technical Roadmap | 技術路線圖
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js for the user dashboard.
- **Backend**: Node.js API to handle file uploads and task queuing.
- **Rendering Engine**: Headless Chrome running on a powerful cloud GPU instance.
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for hosting the recorded videos.

---

## 🚀 3. Subscription Pricing (SaaS Model) | 訂閱定價
- **Free Tier**: 1 Recording per month (Watermarked).
- **Pro Tier ($19/mo)**: Unlimited Solo recordings + Custom Backgrounds.
- **Agency Tier ($99/mo)**: Unlimited Duo recordings + Team management + API access.

---

## 🚀 4. Why SaaS is the "End Game" | 為什麼 SaaS 是終極目標
- **Accessibility**: Users can record from their phone or a slow laptop. (突破硬體限制)
- **Passive Income**: Subscriptions provide predictable, monthly revenue. (穩定的每月經常性收入)
- **Valuation**: A SaaS business is worth 10x more than a service-based business if you ever decide to sell. (極高的公司估值)

## 💡 Final Thought | 最終總結
You have built the "Brain" of this SaaS today. Every script and template we've created is the foundational logic for what will one day be a global platform for VTubers.
