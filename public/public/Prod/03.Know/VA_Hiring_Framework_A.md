## 📝 1. The "Skill Test" Task | 技術測試任務
Never hire based on a resume alone. Give them this 30-minute test.
永遠不要只看履歷就找人，給他們這項 30 分鐘的測試。

- **The Task**: "Here is a 15-second raw MP4 recording and a Google Sheet script. Please use CapCut to add our brand subtitles (Success Gold) and trending music. Then, find 3 relevant threads on r/Live2D where this video could be a helpful reply."
- **重點**：測試他們是否能理解您的「品牌視覺組」並正確操作工具。

## 💬 2. Interview Questions | 核心面試提議
Use these 3 questions to find a "Growth-Mindset" partner.
使用這三個問題來尋找具備「成長心態」的夥伴。

1. **Self-Correction**: "What would you do if a recording script failed while I was asleep?" (測試其應變能力)
2. **Efficiency**: "After doing our daily routine for a week, how would you suggest making it faster?" (測試其優化思維)
3. **Interest**: "Are you familiar with VTubers or Live2D? What do you think is the coolest part of this tool?" (測試其對產業的熱忱)

## 💰 3. The "Trial Period" Structure | 試用期制度
- **Days 1-7**: Paid training. They do the tasks while you watch.
- **Day 8**: If they passed, move to a monthly contract.
- **重點**：設定清晰的試用期，能在不合適時快速止損。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
The best VAs are those who ask "Why?". It means they want to understand your business, not just click buttons. These are the people who will eventually help you manage your entire **Discord Community**.
