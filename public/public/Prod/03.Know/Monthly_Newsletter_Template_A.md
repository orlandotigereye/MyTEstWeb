**Subject**: Live2D Automation Monthly: New Tips & Showcase Highlights 🚀
**主旨**：Live2D 自動化月報：新技巧與成果精選 🚀

"Hi [Name], 

Welcome to this month's update from the **Live2D Automation Lab**! I’ve been busy improving the tool and helping artists save time on their showcases.

### 🌟 This Month’s Highlight | 本月精選
Check out this incredible showcase recorded by one of our community members: **[Link to a User's Video/Tweet]**. The physics look absolutely smooth!

### 💡 Pro Rigging Tip | 專家綁定技巧
Did you know that setting your **physics damping** slightly higher helps the automation tool capture more realistic movement during slow-motion recording? Give it a try in your next project!

### 🛠️ What's New? | 工具更新
- We just updated the **Rigging Checklist** with a new section on texture atlas optimization.
- The **Pro Bundle** now includes a new "Night Cafe" background!

**Ready to upgrade?**
If you're still using the free version and want to record duo dialogues or use our premium backgrounds, you can upgrade to the **Pro Creator Bundle** here: **[Link to Gumroad]**

Happy creating,
[Your Name]"
