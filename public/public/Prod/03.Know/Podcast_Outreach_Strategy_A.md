## 💬 3. The "Expert Guest" Pitch | 嘉賓提案腳本
"Hi [Host Name], I’ve been a listener of [Show Name] for a while—I loved the episode with [Previous Guest]! 

I’m currently leading a project called **Live2D Portfolio Master**, where we’re using browser-based automation to solve the massive recording bottleneck for riggers. I’d love to come on the show to share some technical insights on how artists can use automation to double their creative output without more labor. I think your audience of creators would find the 'Zero-Hands' recording logic really fascinating!"

## 📝 4. Key Talking Points | 準備好談話重點
Always have 3 "Stories" ready:
準備好三個核心故事：
1. **The Problem**: Why manual recording is the silent killer of artist productivity.
2. **The Logic**: How 12 FPS and Puppeteer create "Perfect Physics."
3. **The Future**: How automation will allow every artist to run their own "Mini-Studio."

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
At the end of every interview, offer a **Unique Discount Code** (e.g., "PODCAST20") specifically for that show's audience. This allows you to track exactly how many sales each interview generates.
