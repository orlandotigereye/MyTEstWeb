How to turn your $5/day experiment into a high-profit sales machine.
如何將每日 5 美元的實驗轉化為高獲利的銷售機器。

## 📈 1. Phase 1: The "Data Collection" (Days 1-7) | 數據收集期
**Goal**: Identify which Hook and which Platform has the lowest **Cost Per Download (CPD)**.
- **Action**: Use all 3 variations from the **Ad Copy Bank**.
- **Metric**: If CPD is over $1.00, stop the ad and change the video "Hook" text.
- **目標**：找出下載成本最低的「勾子」與平台。

---

## 📈 2. Phase 2: The "Winner" Scale (Days 8-21) | 獲利放大期
**Goal**: Increase budget ONLY on the winning ads.
- **Action**: Increase daily budget by **20% every 3 days** if the ROI stays positive.
- **Formula**: If $5/day brings 1 sale of $29 ($24 profit), move to $6/day.
- **目標**：僅針對獲利廣告，每三天小幅增加 20% 預算。

## 📈 3. Phase 3: High-Ticket Retargeting (Days 22-30) | 高端再行銷
**Goal**: Reach people who clicked but didn't buy.
- **Action**: Create a new ad variation specifically for " Consideration" (Phase 3 of the Customer Journey).
- **Offer**: "Still undecided? See how our tool saved 10 hours for [Artist Name]." Link to your **Case Study Template**.
- **目標**：針對「有點興趣但未購買」的人，展示案例研究以建立信任。

---

## 📉 4. The "Stop-Loss" Rule | 止損規則
If you spend **$30 (6 days of ads)** and get **Zero Sales** of the Pro Bundle:
- **Action**: STOP all ads. 
- **Check**: Is the Gumroad page confusing? Is the Email sequence working? Do not spend more money until the "Funnel" is fixed.
- **重點**：如果在 6 天內沒達成任何專業版銷售，請立即停機檢查漏斗環節。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Use the **Ad ROI Calculator** daily. Your goal is to reach an ROI of **300% or higher**. Once you hit that, you can comfortably increase your budget knowing that for every $1 you spend, you are getting $3 back.
