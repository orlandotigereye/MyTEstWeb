## 🧠 1. The Value-Based Anchor | 基於價值的定價錨點
Never apologize for your price. Anchor it to the money the client saves.
永遠不要為您的定價道歉。將價格錨定在客戶能節省的成本上。
- **Don't**: "It costs $500."
- **Do**: "For a 5-member group, manual recording takes 15+ hours of studio time. Our automation engine reduces this to 30 minutes. At an agency rate of $100/hr, we are saving you $1,500 in labor. Our fee is $499."
- **重點**：讓客戶覺得不買反而是虧損。

## 🧠 2. The "Consultative" Approach | 顧問式銷售
Ask questions before giving a price. This builds high perceived value.
在報價前先提問，這能建立極高的價值認知。
- **Q1**: "What is your current workflow for showcase recordings?"
- **Q2**: "What is the biggest technical bottleneck your riggers face?"
- **Why**: By diagnosing their problem first, your price becomes a **Prescription (藥方)**, not a "Cost."

## 🧠 3. Handling the "No Budget" Objection | 處理「沒預算」疑慮
If an agency says it’s too expensive:
如果經紀公司嫌貴：
- **Action**: Offer a **Pilot Project (試點專案)**.
- **Pitch**: "I understand. Let's do a pilot for ONE model at $99. If you love the result and the time saved, we can move forward with the full group package later."
- **重點**：降低第一次合作的門檻，讓成果自己說話。

---

## 🧠 4. The "Limited Capacity" Close | 限額結案法
Agencies want to work with "In-Demand" experts.
經紀公司想與「供不應求」的專家合作。
- **Pitch**: "I only take on 2 custom studio setups per month to ensure the highest technical quality. I have one slot left for [Month]. Would you like to secure it today?"
- **重點**：利用稀缺性促使對方儘快下決定。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Always send a **Professional Invoice** immediately after they say "Yes" in the DM. Striking while the iron is hot is the key to preventing "Buyer's Remorse."
