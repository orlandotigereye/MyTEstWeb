## 🔍 1. Defining the Landscape | 定義競爭版圖
Track these two types of competitors:
追蹤這兩類競爭對手：

- **Direct Competitors**: People selling similar Live2D recording scripts or plugins on Booth.pm or Gumroad. (直接對手：販售相似腳本的人)
- **Indirect Competitors**: High-end rigging studios that offer recording as a manual service. (間接對手：提供手動錄影服務的工作室)

## 📊 2. The Audit Table | 稽核表格結構
Use this in a private sheet every 90 days.
每 90 天在私密試算表執行一次。

| Competitor | Pricing | Key Features | Marketing Hook | Weakness (Gap) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Studio X | $50/vid | Manual, high-res | "Bespoke quality" | Very slow delivery. |
| Tool Y | $15 one-time | Basic script | "Cheap & Easy" | Bad physics stability. |
| **YOU** | **$0 / $29** | **Automated, 12fps**| **"Zero-Hands Pro"** | (Identify your gap here) |

## 🕵️ 3. Sentiment Analysis | 情緒分析 (挖掘機會)
- **Action**: Read the 1-star and 3-star reviews of competitor tools.
- **Action**: Look at the "Help" channels in rival Discord servers.
- **Goal**: Find the #1 feature people are asking for that your competitor ISN'T providing.
- **目標**：找出使用者強烈要求但對手尚未提供的「核心功能」。

---

## 🛠️ 4. Strategic Response | 戰略應對行動
Based on your audit, choose ONE action:
根據稽核結果，選擇一項行動：
- [ ] **Price Adjustment**: If everyone is cheaper, emphasize your "ROI" and "Time Saved."
- [ ] **Feature Sprint**: If someone added a "Lighting" tool, accelerate your **v1.5 Cinematic Update**.
- [ ] **Marketing Pivot**: If competitors are too "Technical," make your marketing even more "Artist-Friendly."

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Don't copy your competitors. Use their data to find the **"Empty Space"** in the market. If everyone is selling a "Recording Tool," you should sell a **"Content Production Partner."**
