## 💰 1. The Four "Profit Buckets" | 四大資金分配
Don't spend all your profit. Divide it using the **40/30/20/10 Rule**:
不要花掉所有利潤，使用 **40/30/20/10 原則** 進行分配：

- **40% Growth (廣告與行銷)**: Reinvest into **Paid Ads Strategy**. If $150/mo brings in $700, this bucket should grow every month.
- **30% Software Fund (SaaS 研發)**: Save this for the future **SaaS Vision**. This will pay for your custom GUI and cloud servers.
- **20% Personal Income (個人報酬)**: Pay yourself! This keeps you motivated and proves the project is a "Real Business."
- **10% Safety Reserve (應急儲備)**: For technical emergencies or specialized consulting fees.

## 📈 2. Scaling the Ad Spend | 廣告規模化
Once your **Ad ROI Calculator** shows a positive ROI for 14 consecutive days:
當您的「廣告 ROI 計算機」連續 14 天顯示正值時：
- **Action**: Increase the daily budget by **$2/day**.
- **Action**: Monitor the **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**. If CAC stays low, keep increasing until you hit $20/day.
- **重點**：穩定的獲利廣告是達成每月 5,000 美元的最快途徑。

## 🛠️ 3. Reinvesting in Efficiency | 投資於效率
When you hit **$500/month revenue**:
當您達成月營收 500 美元時：
- **Move**: Transition from doing 100% of the work to 50% of the work.
- **Action**: Use the **VA Hiring Framework** to hire someone for the **Daily Growth Routine**.
- **重點**：花錢買回自己的時間，用來進行高階開發（如 v2.0）。

## 🚀 4. Reinvesting in Authority | 投資於權威
Use a portion of the "Growth Bucket" to sponsor minor VTuber events.
利用「成長錢包」的一部分預算來贊助小型 VTuber 活動。
- **Action**: Provide a "Pro Bundle" prize for a community art contest.
- **Benefit**: Your brand name appears alongside top artists, building massive long-term trust.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Treat the **Software Fund** as a separate bank account. By the time you are ready for **SaaS Transition**, you will have $2,000+ ready to pay for high-end Electron development or cloud architecture!
