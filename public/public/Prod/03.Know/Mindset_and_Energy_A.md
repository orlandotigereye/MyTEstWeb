## 🧠 1. The "Marathon" Mindset | 馬拉松心態
Building a business is slow at first. Expect "Zero Responses" for the first 14 days.
創業初期進度緩慢。請做好前 14 天「零回應」的心理準備。
- **Action**: Focus on the **Input** (Did I post today?), not the **Output** (How many likes did I get?).
- **行動**：專注於「投入」（我今天發文了嗎？），而非「產出」（我得到了多少讚？）。
- **Why**: You can control your actions, but you cannot control the algorithm.

## ⚡ 2. Energy over Time | 能量優先於時間
Don't work on your project when you are exhausted. 15 minutes of "High Energy" work is better than 2 hours of "Tired" work.
不要在筋疲力竭時處理專案。15 分鐘的「高能量」工作遠勝過 2 小時的「疲憊」工作。
- **The Golden Hour**: Find the time of day when you are most creative (e.g., 6 AM before work or 9 PM after a rest). Use that time ONLY for building/innovation.
- **黃金時段**：找出您最有創意的時段，僅將該時段用於開發或創新。

## 🛡️ 3. Protecting Your Vision | 保護您的願景
- **Avoid "Comparison Trap"**: Do not look at VTuber creators who have been active for 5 years and feel bad that you are just starting.
- **避免比較陷阱**：不要拿自己剛起步的狀態去跟經營五年的大帳號比較。
- **Win Log**: Celebrate every small win (e.g., "First person thanked me for the tip").

## 🚿 4. The 24-Hour Reset | 24 小時重置規則
If a post fails or a tech bug feels overwhelming: **Step away for 24 hours.**
如果貼文失敗或技術錯誤讓您感到壓力山大：**遠離專案 24 小時。**
- The world won't end. Your business will still be there tomorrow. A rested brain finds solutions faster than a stressed one.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Use the **Weekly Review Form** to track your "Energy Score." If your energy is consistently low (under 4/10), it's a sign you need to simplify your routine or delegate more tasks to a VA.
